Summary: Building an Addresses together in an organized way for family and friends so I could easily mail greeting cards. The most common issues I faced were:
- The addresses I had in my address book were old
- I had received updated addresses but not put them in any central repository of any kind, so ended up with multiple addresses from multiple sources for the same people - not knowing which was the current
- I didn't have addresses at all
These were just some of the highlights, so I resorted to texting and emailing multiple people and of course I forgot a lot of them in the process. Therefore, for this code challenge we will solve the issue by building an address management solution for friends and family - Detailed requirements below.
Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication. - Leonardo da Vinci
Requirements
The main functions of the app are:
- I should be able to see Names, Addresses for family and friends (hint: alpha blog)
- I should be able to search for addresses in a search box - either by name or email address (hint: stock tracker)
- I should be able to click a button to print a label for the address in good format - or multiple addresses per page (extra credit). I should be able to edit the name field, or add & family of this address label, the default should be the account holders first and last name
The supporting functions you'll need to implement in order to offer this:
- Family members or friends should be able to create accounts for themselves in the app (both devise or regular authentication system built from scratch accepted, email authentication extra credit)
- They should be able to add First Name, Last Name, MI, Address
- Address should be in the format of Address 1, Address 2, City, Zip and Country
- Optional - Telephone numbers
- They should be able to edit their information
- They should be able to delete their information
- Only family members or friends themselves will be able to edit their own information, however, address information can be seen by other family members or friends
- All members should have access to the main functions of the app listed above
- Only you (the admin, or anyone else you designate as admin) should be able to remove people's accounts
- Only you (the admin, or anyone else you designate as admin) should be able to edit/update other people's information
Very important:
- Extra (a lot) of points given to good styling
- Extra points for good code practices
- Extra points for good user experience
Rules:
- This can be a group project, maximum 4 members per group
- Competition begins January 25th, 2017 and ends February 15, 2017. All code must be submitted by then in the google doc here
- You can use code from the course github repo's as you see fit but please don't copy paste directly
- You can use the live chat to get partners for your group
- TA (Sasikala), myself or Evgeny cannot be used as a resource for help
